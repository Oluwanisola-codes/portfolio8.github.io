    <h1>About Me </h1>
</section>
<section class="about2">
    <p> I am a resourceful, and confident writer who has over three years of experience
        working across more than six industries, ranging from PR,communications to media and tech. 
        In addition, i am a coder {I wrote the code for this landing page}. <br>
        When I'm not writing or coding, you can find me watching the latest tv shows or reading a not-so-scary book. 
        I also enjoy watching tiktok videos and eating chicken.
